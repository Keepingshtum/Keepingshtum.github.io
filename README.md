This will host the website I'm making for a project!

Who: I, Anant Shukla, am the only one working on this website :D

What: It's going to be a website for fantasy premier league stuff (as of now)

When: Currently it's just a basic page, but hopefully it becomes a bit more sightly!

Why: It's a good way to practice web design and full stack development!

How: Currently using a combination of HTML+Bootstrap. 

### Currently on hold as I'm pursuing other projects at the moment. Check back in a few months! (i.e August 2020)
