# Keepingshtum.github.io

Hosts all the various projects I've thought up and promptly abandoned over the years - but hopefully this time I'll get something done!

Originally was supposed to be a website for FPL stuff:

Who: I, Anant Shukla, am the only one working on this website :D

What: It's going to be a website for fantasy premier league stuff (as of now)

When: Currently it's just a basic page, but hopefully it becomes a bit more sightly!

Why: It's a good way to practice web design and full stack development!

How: Currently using a combination of HTML+Bootstrap. 

### Currently on hold as I'm pursuing other projects at the moment. Check back in a few months! (i.e August 2020)

### Update April 14: I've realised Pure HTML is only good to do the front-end, and I'll need some sort of framework to ensure the website actually works. This means learning react/flask and making the website happen with that! So the website will soon be removed and a brand new solution ( a react or a flask app) should take its place on resuming development!
